1. ASCII Character Codes

Definition: 

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers and other devices that use text. It encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers.

Character Set: 

ASCII includes 33 non-printing control characters (such as carriage return, line feed, and null character) and 95 printable characters, which include letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, punctuation marks, and special symbols.

Usage and Compatibility: A

SCII serves as the basis for most modern character encoding systems and ensures compatibility across different devices and platforms by providing a standardized way to represent text. It is especially significant in early computing and data transmission standards.

2. In C programming, the printf() function is used to output formatted text to the standard output (usually the screen). The format specifiers in printf() dictate how the subsequent arguments are formatted.

3. In C programming, the scanf() function is used for input, reading formatted data from the standard input (usually the keyboard). It uses format specifiers to interpret the input data and store the values in the provided variable addresses. 

These specifiers are used in the format string of scanf() to parse the input and store it into the corresponding variables. It's crucial to provide the correct variable addresses for each specifier, using the & operator except for strings (arrays).

4.Functions for character input and output


In C programming, several functions are available for handling character input and output. These functions are part of the C standard library, typically included via the <stdio.h> header. Below are the key functions used for character input and output.

7.Utility functions

Utility functions in C, often included in the <stdlib.h> and other standard library headers, provide essential operations for tasks like memory allocation, process control, searching, sorting, and converting data types.
